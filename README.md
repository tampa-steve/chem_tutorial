# Welcome to my GitHub repository. As a retired chemistry teacher, I was wondering if we could create an interactive program
# for general chemistry students using the GitHub platform. Please feel free to use the python code contained herein and
# modify it as desired. You can reach me at palm5517@gmail.com with your questions, suggestions, and comments, in general.
